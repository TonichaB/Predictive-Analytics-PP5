            Based on the correlation analysis:
            - **Overall Quality (OveralQual)** shows the strongest positive correlation with sale prices, indicating that higher overall quality significantly increases house value.
            - **Ground Floor Living Area (GrLivArea)** is also strongly correlated, highlighting the importance of usable living space in determining sale price.
            - **1st Floor Surface Area (1stFlrSF)** and the **Overall Score (OverallScore)** further reinforce that larger, high-quality properties command higher prices.
            - **Garage Area (Garage Area)** and **Age of Property (Age)** contribute meaningfully to predicting sale prices.
